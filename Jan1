Chapter 2: The Logic of Compound Statements

Integers - Z - -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 - 
Natural Numbers: Positive Integers (Not including zero) : 1, 2, 3, ... : lN : Z+
Whole Numbers: W: 0, 1, 2, 3...
Rational Numbers: Q : -2.5, -1, 0, 2.2, 10.3, ... : a/b where a, b are integers
Irrational Numbers: Any real number that are not rational numbers
Real Numbers: R: Rational and Irrational Numbers
Complex Numbers: C: a + bi, ab are real numbers

E : Element       2 E Z : 2 is an element of Integers
E/: Not element   1/3 E/ Z: 1/3 is not an element of Integers
_C: Comparison between sets   Z C_ Q
:.: Therefore

Real Number System: composed of Integers, Rational and Irrational Systems
  Two major operations are addition and multiplication

1) Both operations are communicative and associative
  Communicative: 2 + 3 = 3 + 2
  Associative: (1 + 2) + 3 = 1 + (2 + 3)

2) There is an additive Identity (0) and a multiplicative identity (1)
3) Additive Inverse (a & -a) and Multiplicative Inverse (a & 1/a)
4) The operation multiplication distributes over addition ( a * (b + c) = (a * b) + (a * c)
  Not the other way around
    In boolean algebra, it works the other way around

NOW WRITING THE BLANKS ONLY

__ or __ : propositions or statements
a __ is a : statement
1) no, no definition of a large number
2) yes, but a false statement
3) yes
4) no
5) no, because this is a question


but = and

H: It is hot
D: It is dry

H ^ ~D

~:  negation, not
^:  wconjunction, and
v:  inclusivedisjunction, or
to: exclusive disjunction, exclusive or

neither p nor q = not p and not q = ~p ^ ~q = ~(pvq)

~Cv~S
~S^~C^D
2 <= x <= 5

x => 2 and x <= 5
(x >= a) and (x <= b)
(x > a or x = a) and (x < 5 or x = 5)
(P +O Q) ^ (R +O S)

Negation, ~
Conjunction, ^
Inclusive Disjunction, v
Exclusive Disjunction, +O

FROM NOW ON I AM GOING TO PRINT OUT THE LECTURE NOTES BEFORE CLASS, I THINK I CAN SMOOTHLY FIT 3 PER PAGE
