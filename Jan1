Chapter 2: The Logic of Compound Statements

Integers - Z - -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 - 
Natural Numbers: Positive Integers (Not including zero) : 1, 2, 3, ... : lN : Z+
Whole Numbers: W: 0, 1, 2, 3...
Rational Numbers: Q : -2.5, -1, 0, 2.2, 10.3, ... : a/b where a, b are integers
Irrational Numbers: Any real number that are not rational numbers
Real Numbers: R: Rational and Irrational Numbers
Complex Numbers: C: a + bi, ab are real numbers

E : Element       2 E Z : 2 is an element of Integers
E/: Not element   1/3 E/ Z: 1/3 is not an element of Integers
_C: Comparison between sets   Z C_ Q
:.: Therefore

Real Number System: composed of Integers, Rational and Irrational Systems
  Two major operations are addition and multiplication

1) Both operations are communicative and associative
  Communicative: 2 + 3 = 3 + 2
  Associative: (1 + 2) + 3 = 1 + (2 + 3)

2) There is an additive Identity (0) and a multiplicative identity (1)
3) Additive Inverse (a & -a) and Multiplicative Inverse (a & 1/a)
4) The operation multiplication distributes over addition ( a * (b + c) = (a * b) + (a * c)
  Not the other way around
    In boolean algebra, it works the other way around

NOW WRITING THE BLANKS ONLY

__ or __ : propositions or statements
a __ is a : statement
1) no, no definition of a large number
2) yes, but a false statement
3) yes
4) no
5) no, because this is a question


but = and

H: It is hot
D: It is dry

H ^ ~D

~:  negation, not
^:  wconjunction, and
v:  inclusivedisjunction, or
to: exclusive disjunction, exclusive or

neither p nor q = not p and not q = ~p ^ ~q = ~(pvq)

~Cv~S
~S^~C^D
2 <= x <= 5

x => 2 and x <= 5
(x >= a) and (x <= b)
(x > a or x = a) and (x < 5 or x = 5)
(P +O Q) ^ (R +O S)

Negation, ~
Conjunction, ^
Inclusive Disjunction, v
Exclusive Disjunction, +O

FROM NOW ON I AM GOING TO PRINT OUT THE LECTURE NOTES BEFORE CLASS, I THINK I CAN SMOOTHLY FIT 3 PER PAGE

Didnt know word to pdf... rip day 2 of typing in the fill in the blanks


difference between v and +o

(p or q) or p and q = pvq v p^q

Ex: Cream or Sugar -> V
    To ride a coaster, you must be 12 or 4ft+ -> V

    Pass or Fail -> +o
    Tea or Coffee -> +o
    Open or Close -> +o
    x >= 5 or x < 5 -> +o

well-defined truth values
the truth table

Ex: P: John is a sophomore  Q: John is a CS Major

p q ~p p^q pvq p+oq
t t f  t   t   f
t f f  f   t   t
f t t  f   t   t
f f t  f   f   f
 
~p is true when p is false
p^q is true when both are true
pvq is true when at least one is true
p+oq is true when only one is true

Logical Equivalence

two form are logically equivalent is and only if
we note than p=_ q (three lines vertically)

p=_q is the same as

p q
t t
t t
f f
t t

p v p =_ p

p ~p  ~(~p)
t f   t
f t   f

~~p =_ p

p q ~p ~q ~pv~q pvq ~(pvq) 
t t  f  f  f    t   f              
t f  f  t  t    t   f              
f t  t  f  t    t   f            
f f  t  t  t    f   t               

not logically equivalent bc third to last and last column, 2nd and 3rd row

We showed that ~(pvq) +-/ ~pv~q
-----------------------------
Cream or Suger : CvS
~(CvS) =_ ~C^~S

Cream and Sugar : C^S
~(C^S) =_ ~Cv~S

~V =_ ^
~^ =_ V
-------------------------------
the negation of an ^ to the V
the negation of an V to the ^

1) ~pv~q
2) ~p^~q
3) 

~( x >= -pi ^ x < 2e )
 =_ ~(x >= pi) v ~ (x < 2e)
  =_ x < -pi v x <= 2e


a tautology is a statement form that is always true           EX: john is smart or he is not smart
a contradiction is a statement form that is always false       EX: john is smart and he is not smart

EX: T : P v ~P
    C : P ^ ~P

p ~p  pv~p  p^~p
t  f  t     f        
f  t  t     f        

p T F P^T P^F
t t f t   f        
f t f f   f          

p =_ p^T
p^F =_ F

domination vs identity laws
ask to take picture of after class^^

                       Real NO        Logic
operations            +, *            v, ^
Identity              0, 1            F, T
Distributive Laws     a*(b+c)=a*b+a*c p^(qvr)=p^q v p^r

other laws

demorgans ~pvq =_ ~p^~q AND ~(p^q) =_ ~pv ~q
idempotent  pVp =_ p^p
domination  pvT =_ T  p^F =_ F
Absorption  
Double Negative ~(~p) =_ p

Absorbtion laws:

pv(p^q) =_ p
p^(pvq) =_ p

same item had to be in the parenthesis (p)
opposite operators inside and outside the parenthesis
q can be any value, it will always go to p
